Hello everybody! My name is Christan Molina. Throughout my university life I started to have a great interest in programming, especially with subjects like GIS and SDI.

I signed up in diferents courses about web programming. In that moment I realised that I really wanted to spend my time in this matter.

So nowadays I'm learning html, css, java, javascript and php.
