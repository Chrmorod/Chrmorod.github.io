## What is Jekyll?
Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.

Jekyll is a generator of static sites written in Ruby. A generator of static sites takes a series of text files (written in Markdown) and templates that are processed to finally get pages of HTML ready to publish in any server.

Jekyll is designed to create static blogs. We can publish and maintain our blog by simply managing a directory of text files.

With Jekyll you can replace WordPress, Joomla or any CMS, has friendly urls, categories, pages, posts, templates, etc.

## Advantages
Speed: We are serving static pages, we do not need to speak with a database to ask for the information in each request or to give data in the server.
<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
<ul>
    <li>Security:</li> There is no database or dynamic content that can be hacked.

    <li>Less maintenance:</li> Since we do not have a database, we do not have to worry about configuring or maintaining it.

    <li>Free hosting:</li> We can host our site for free in Github Pages.
</ul>
</div>
